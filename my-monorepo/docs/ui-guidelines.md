# UI Guidelines for My Monorepo

## Introduction
This document outlines the UI guidelines for the components and styles used across the applications in the monorepo. The goal is to ensure a consistent and cohesive user experience.

## Design Principles
1. **Consistency**: Maintain a uniform look and feel across all applications. Use the same color palette, typography, and spacing.
2. **Accessibility**: Ensure that all components are accessible to users with disabilities. Follow WCAG guidelines for color contrast and keyboard navigation.
3. **Responsiveness**: Design components to be responsive and work well on various screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.

## Color Palette
- Primary Color: #3498db
- Secondary Color: #2ecc71
- Accent Color: #e74c3c
- Background Color: #ecf0f1
- Text Color: #2c3e50

## Typography
- **Font Family**: 'Roboto', sans-serif
- **Headings**: Use a consistent hierarchy (H1, H2, H3, etc.) with appropriate font sizes.
- **Body Text**: Use a legible size (16px) with a line height of 1.5 for better readability.

## Component Guidelines
### Buttons
- Use primary and secondary button styles consistently.
- Ensure buttons have sufficient padding and margin for touch targets.

### Cards
- Maintain a consistent card layout with image, title, and description.
- Use shadows and borders to create depth.

### Layout
- Use a grid system to align components properly.
- Ensure adequate spacing between elements to avoid clutter.

## Iconography
- Use a consistent set of icons throughout the applications.
- Ensure icons are clear and convey the intended action or meaning.

## Documentation
- Document each component with usage examples and code snippets.
- Include guidelines for when and how to use each component.

## Conclusion
Following these guidelines will help create a unified and user-friendly interface across all applications in the monorepo. Regularly review and update these guidelines as the design evolves.
